# async-lecture-examples

This material accompanies the **Working with asynchronous Javascript** lecture.

## How to use

Clone and `npm install`

Examples can be run from the command line by doing:

```
node example-1.js
```

## Requirements
Written using `node@v10.15.1`. Cannot garantee `async/await` (example 5 and 6) will work in previous versions of node.
